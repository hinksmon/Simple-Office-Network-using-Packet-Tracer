# Simple-Office-Network-using-Packet-Tracer
[Brief Objective - Remove this afterwards]

In this Project I built a simple office network using multiple switches and multiple devices while also configuring IP addresses for each of the connected devices. The primary focus for this project is to connect the accounts department to the delivery department together while each of the departments need to contain at least 2 PCs, the appropriate number of switches and routers, while keeping the Ip adresses in the range of 192.168.40.0. while the correct configurations for subnet masked and default gateways aswell. All devices will have the appropriate cables and should be able to ping eachother.

Skills Learned
- Proficiency in ip address configuration
- Ability to  set up my own network
- Enhanced knowledge of network configurations 
  

Tools Used

- Cisco Packet Tracer 

Steps

1. I started off the project by putting 1 router for the network and 2 switched for the 2 different departments (Accounts and Delivery), then in each subnet added 2 PCs and 1 printer each to finish off the layout of the network.

2.  Then i connected the proper cables using the automatic cable option to connect the PCs and printers to the correct subnets, then the subnets to the router.

3.  After that with the given network address 192.168.40.0 I connected all the interfaces to the appropriate IP addresses, subnet masks, and gateways together.

4.  After calculating the Subnet mask, Network ID, Range of Valid host, and brodcast ID I am ready to implement them into my network.

5.  Next I started configuring the routers interfaces to the correct ip addresses that I came up with.

6.  After that I assigned Ip addresses to the host devices on the network.

7.  Finally after the ip addresses were assigned I tested them to make sure they were all able to ping correctly to eachother.
