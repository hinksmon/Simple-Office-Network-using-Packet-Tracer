The primary focus for this project is to connect the accounts department to the delivery department together while each of the departments need to contain at least 2 PCs, the appropriate number of switches and routers, while keeping the Ip adresses in the range of 192.168.40.0. while the correct configurations for subnet masked and default gateways aswell. All devices will have the appropriate cables and should be able to ping eachother.
